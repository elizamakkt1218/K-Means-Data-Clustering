# K-Means-Data-Clustering
This is one of the course projects of COMP2026 Problem Solving Using Object Oriented Programming. Applied the K-Means algorithm, the program will be able to classified data points into k clusters, where the distance of the data points to the centroid of their own cluster is minimized.
